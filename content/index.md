My name is [Vince Speelman](http://twitter.com/vinspee). I'm a front-end developer from Detroit, Michigan that loves moving the web forward. My weapons of choice are CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I love good tools and people that care about doing the right thing.

I'm dedicated to responsive web design, unwavering semantics, and modular code.
I've created [JD Power Award-winning responsive web apps for multi-billion
dollar financial institutions](http://myql.com/), [social communities for teen
pop idols](http://allisimpson.com/), [apps that make people
better](http://leveleleven.com/), [simple tools](http://my.bankrate.com) for
[scary](http://my.creditcards.com) [topics](http://quizzle.com).

I'm currently [http://ted.com](spreading ideas) with the smartest team in the
world.

I [ship code](http://github.com/vinspee) outside of my day job and I fight for what's right inside of it.

User experience is king. Accessibility and interoperability must not be an afterthought. Progressive enhancement is a mantra.

Off-screen, I'm a husband, [musician](https://soundcloud.com/vince-speelman), coffee and [beer snob](https://untappd.com/user/Vinspee), [food lover](http://instagram.com/vinspee), and [cat dad](http://instagram.com/clubbedchuck).

Let's get to know eachother. You can [follow me](http://twitter.com/vinspee) if you'd like a never-ending stream of GIFs and geekery sprinkled with a healthy dose of consipracy theories and civil disobedience.
