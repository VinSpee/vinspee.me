My name is [Vince Speelman](http://twitter.com/vinspee). I'm a front-end developer from Detroit, Michigan and I believe in the web. I use Javascript, HTML, and CSS to accomplish goals and solve real problems. I love good tools and working with people that care about doing the right thing.  I'm dedicated to responsive web design, unwavering semantics, and practical code.  I've created [web apps that spread important ideas to millions of people a week](https://www.ted.com/), [Loyalty tools for high-end retailers](https://usejewel.com/), [JD Power Award-winning responsive experiences for multi-billion dollar financial institutions](http://myql.com/), [apps that make people better](http://leveleleven.com/), and [simple tools](http://my.bankrate.com) for [scary](http://my.creditcards.com) [topics](http://quizzle.com).

I'm currently [spreading ideas](https://www.ted.com) with the smartest team in the
world.

I [ship code and give back](http://github.com/vinspee) outside of my day job and I fight for what's right inside of it.

User experience is king. Accessibility and interoperability can not be an afterthought. Developer ergonimics are truly important. Shipping is a must.

Off-screen, I'm a husband, [musician](https://soundcloud.com/vince-speelman), [beer snob](https://untappd.com/user/Vinspee), and [VW Vanagon Owner](http://instagram.com/vinspee).

Let's get to know each-other. You can [follow me](http://twitter.com/vinspee) to see a bit of how I think and what I'm up to.

[Reach out](/contact) and lets see if we can `/(work|play)/` together.
